## Introduction to SnoozeMail

We’ve all been there—you receive an important email, but it’s not urgent **right now**, so you think, “I’ll get back to it later.”  
But _later_ turns into _never_, and the email gets buried under dozens of others. That’s exactly the problem **SnoozeMail** was built to solve.

SnoozeMail lets you forward any email to a special address like `2days@snoozemail.in`, and it will come back to your inbox exactly **when you want it**—no fancy extensions, no third-party apps, and no distractions.

Let’s get started.

## How It Works

Using SnoozeMail is incredibly simple. Here’s a step-by-step walkthrough:

1. **Sign Up**  
   Visit [snoozemail.in](https://snoozemail.in) and create a free account. You’ll get access to your personal dashboard where you can manage your reminders.

2. **Forward an Email**  
   Got an email you want to deal with later? Just forward it to:
   - `tomorrow@snoozemail.in` → returns tomorrow
   - `3days@snoozemail.in` → returns in 3 days
   - `25jul@snoozemail.in` → returns on July 25
   - `friday9am@snoozemail.in` → returns at 9am on Friday

3. **Get Reminded**  
   When the time comes, SnoozeMail automatically sends the email back to your inbox—like magic.

4. **Manage from Dashboard**  
   Want to see what's scheduled or cancel a snooze? Log into your dashboard to view, reschedule, or delete reminders anytime.
